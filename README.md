# Project Description



## ***Overview*** 
Within months, COVID-19 went from an epidemic to a pandemic and has affected people's lives in many ways all over the world. From the first identified case in December 2019, how did the virus spread so fast and widely? <br>
Out of curiosity, I explored the open dataset from the World Health Organization website and tried to applied the analysis skills all together I have learned to this ongoing real-world problem. 

## ***Data Availability***  
The main dataset was acquired from the World Health Organization website, date ranging from January 11, 2020, as to June 20, 2020. 
- Data Source: https://covid19.who.int/

## ***Project Workflow*** 
In the first part, I mainly used Python programming with Numpy and Pandas packages for data wrangling including clean and merge datasets. In terms of exploratory data analysis, several visualization tools used include Matplotlib and seaborn. I also self-learned "plotly express", a high-level interface to create many fancy interactive and informative visualizations.
<br> 
<br> 
Secondly, I Integrated Jupyter notebook and MySQL Workbench through API to migrate data from Pandas DataFrame to SQL table
<br> 
<br> 
Last but not least, I connected the MySQL server to Tableau. I built a dashboard and deployed it to the public website for offering interactive data visualization.
